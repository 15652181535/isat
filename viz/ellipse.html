    <h1>Ellipse testing</h1>
    <p>Hopefully, the X and Y portions of the calculated X,Y,Z
      coordinates for a satellite will describe an ellipse. In ECI
      Geodetic coords, Z is aligned with North pole, which the
      satellites nominally orbit around.  Draw some points and see if
      they look fine. Earth coordinates don't enter into the equation
      yet.</p>
    <p>For extra credit, draw short vectors indicating direction of travel.</p>
    <p>For more extra credit, pull values from HTML INPUT text areas</p>

This is an effort to translate Miura's MATLAB code into JavaScript.

That code does the SGP4 calculations.  We'll start with this and
implement a similar functionality to `testmat.m' so we can verify our
math implementation.

Neither the AIAA nor Miura's code do any UI or visualiztions; that will come later.

# How to develop and run this code.

## Ubuntu

We need node and npm for this. So lets setup a virtualenv like atmosphere.

First make sure you have the basics installed (which you prolly do if you have done any developing at all.):

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev

Next we'll install the venv equivalent:

    $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.7.0/install.sh | sh

See https://github.com/creationix/nvm for more about nvm

Then setup node and npm:

    $ nvm install 0.11.13
    $ nvm alias default 0.11.13
    $ nvm use default

In the top level directory:

    ## For global access to grunt commands
    $ npm install -g grunt grunt-cli
    ## Installs our depedencies for isat
    $ npm install

This will install the dependencies.

Run jasmine like so:

	$ grunt dev

And open the test runner like so:

	open http://localhost:9999/jasmine/SpecRunner.html


Then you can run the tests against saucelabs with your key and secret like so:

	$ export SAUCE_USERNAME=YOUR-SAUCE-USERNAME
	$ export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR-SAUCE-API-KEY
  ## Start local server, open sauce tunnel, and run remote browsers against it
  $ grunt test

That's it.
